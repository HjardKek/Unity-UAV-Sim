# INFO
This is my dissertation project. I created a visual representation of flight data in Unity3D. The flight data was given to me from a previous project.

There are missing textures in this repo. This is because the main texture for the ground was a scan of an area. It was a very high resolution scan of a 20km^2 area, meaning the texture file ended up being over 600mb in size.
